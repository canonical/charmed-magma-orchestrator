# magma-nms-magmalte

## Description

Magmaâ€™s NMS provides a single pane of glass for managing Magma based networks. NMS provides the
ability to configure gateways and associated eNodeBs, provides visibility into status, events and
metrics observed in these networks and finally ability to configure and receive alerts. This charm 
deploys Magmalte which is a microservice built using express framework. It contains set of 
application and router level middlewares. It uses sequelize ORM to connect to the NMS DB for 
servicing any routes involving DB interaction. Visit
