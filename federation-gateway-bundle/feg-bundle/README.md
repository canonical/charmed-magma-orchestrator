# magma-feg

## Overview

The federated gateway provides remote procedure call (GRPC) based interfaces to standard 3GPP components, such as HSS (S6a, SWx), OCS (Gy), and PCRF (Gx). The exposed RPC interface provides versioning & backward compatibility, security (HTTP2 & TLS) as well as support for multiple programming languages. The Remote Procedures below provide simple, extensible, multi-language interfaces based on GRPC which allow developers to avoid dealing with the complexities of 3GPP protocols. Implementing these RPC interfaces allows networks running on Magma to integrate with traditional 3GPP core components.

This charm bundle makes it easy to deploy the Federation Gateway component in any Kubernetes environment,
and it has been tested with all major public cloud platforms.

For more information about Magma, see the official documentation [here](https://magmacore.org/).

> :warning: **The bundle is still not available**. If you wish to test the deployment locally, please use the `build.sh` and `deploy.sh` scripts.
